Sunhwa, before meeting you, I can confidently say that I was very lost in the world. After meeting you, I saw a distant light, like a star, and it guided me out of that long dark tunnel from which I came. This is only one of the many ways you have quite literally saved me. So, I want to promise you here and now, before all these witnesses, to love you with all my strength, with all my heart, and with all my mind. What exactly does that mean? Well, 
I don’t really know your native culture well, 
but I do know that in American culture, my culture, we have many, many misconceptions about love. 
I plan to love you more in the winter than in the springtime. I plan to meet you where you are, and far 
beyond where I am, or die trying. I plan to cast off my own love language — 
even cast off my own native tongue— in order to learn and adopt your own. I plan to not so much 
express romance and ardent passion toward you, but to suffer and sacrifice for you. When we visited 
universal studios that one day, your face gleamed like the noontime sun with radiant beauty. When we 
grow old and full of wrinkles, and our bodies decline in health, it won’t matter much, because 
I believe that love is timeless and as long as we choose to love we will always be in love. Thank you 
for choosing me, and thank you, Sunhwa, for remaining with me and finally, thank you for igniting 
the torch which still lights my way out of the darkness to this day.
